# MOCA
The MOCA algorithm uses statistical techniques to search for sets of negatively-correlated rows in a binary matrix. In particular this can be applied to detect sets of anti-co-occurrring somatic mutations in cancer.

NOTE: The example data files in example-data.zip must be extracted into /example-data/ before running mocaexample.R
